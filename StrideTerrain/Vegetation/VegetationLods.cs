/// Stride has no notion of an FBX LOD group, but the importer does bring every reduced mesh
/// through - a LOD chain arrives as a flat mesh list rather than being discarded. The meshes are
/// laid out LOD major, one per material slot:
///
///     [ LOD0 slot0, LOD0 slot1, LOD0 slot2, LOD1 slot0, ... ]
///
/// Two details make the obvious splits wrong, both found by running the importer over every
/// variant in the set rather than just one:
///
///   - The last mesh is the impostor card UE bakes into the chain: two triangles with a material
///     index past the real slots. It has to be dropped, the impostor here is our own baked atlas.
///   - Material order inside a LOD is not stable. Poplar_06_Forest LOD1 arrives as slots 1, 0, 2,
///     so splitting on "material index returned to zero" silently mis-groups it. Slicing by index
///     range is order independent and does not care.

        // entire LOD chain, the impostor bake then renders every level stacked on one origin, and
        // every impostor comes out uniformly dark while the LOD levels still look fine because one
        // level is drawing the whole model. The mesh material indices already say everything needed,
        // and unlike the material list they come straight off the geometry.

        // of Materials.Count, then "a repeated material index starts the next level" - and both
        // depend on the meshes arriving grouped by LOD. That holds for the raw importer output but
        // not necessarily for the compiled model, and when it does not hold the first level
        // degenerates to a single trunk mesh: LODs lose their foliage and the impostor, which bakes
        // from level 0, comes out with no leaves at all.
